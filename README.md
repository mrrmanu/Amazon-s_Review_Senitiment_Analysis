# 🛒Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews to classify customer feedback as positive or negative. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised machine learning models, the project extracts insights from textual reviews to understand customer sentiment and purchasing behavior.

## 🎯 Objectives

Analyze customer sentiment from Amazon product reviews

Perform text preprocessing and feature extraction

Build and evaluate machine learning models for sentiment classification

Identify patterns between ratings, review length, and sentiment

## 📊 Dataset Description

Amazon product reviews dataset (Amazon Alexa reviews)

### Key features include:

verified_reviews – customer review text

rating – user rating

feedback – sentiment label (positive/negative)

variation, date

A new feature "length" was engineered to represent review length

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

### Libraries:

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

NLTK (stopwords, text preprocessing)

Scikit-learn (modeling & evaluation)

Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Handled missing values in review text

Analyzed rating distribution and feedback balance

Studied review length vs sentiment

Verified data types and feature distributions

Observed strong correlation between ratings and sentiment labels

## 🧠 Text Preprocessing

Lowercasing and text normalization

Removal of punctuation and stopwords

Tokenization and vectorization

Feature extraction using TF-IDF / Count Vectorizer

## 🤖 Model Building & Evaluation

Train-test split for model validation

Implemented classification algorithms such as:

Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes

Evaluated models using:

Accuracy score

Confusion matrix

Classification report

## 📈 Key Insights

Positive reviews significantly outnumber negative reviews

Higher ratings strongly align with positive sentiment

Longer reviews tend to contain more detailed feedback

The trained model successfully predicts sentiment from unseen reviews

# 🚀 Conclusion

This project demonstrates practical expertise in NLP, feature engineering, and supervised machine learning. It showcases an end-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline—from raw text to model evaluation—making it highly relevant for Data Analyst / Data Scientist / ML Engineer roles.
